# Iterative Constrained Back-Translation for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation of Machine Translation

Iterative Constrained Back-Translation  (ICBT) apply lexical constraints into back-translation to generate pseudo-parallel data with in-domain lexical knowledge, and then perform round-trip iterations to incorporate more lexical knowledge. We further explore sampling strategies of constrained words in ICBT to introduce more targeted lexical knowledge, via domain specificity and confidence estimation. You can see our COLING 2022 paper for more details.
